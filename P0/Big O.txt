Task0:
This function is constant so it big o O(1)

Task1:
There are two loop but no nest so big o is 2n => O(n)

Task2:
There are two loop, one go through all of list of calls, next one to find the longest phone all
So 2n => O(n)

Task3:
Part A
There are two nested loop (n^2)
Loop to print out put (n)
Loop sort (nlogn)
=> big o is n^2 + nlogn + n

Part B
Only one loop so big O is n

Big O is n^2 + nlogn + n + n = n^2 + 2n

Task4
There are three loop no nest so big o is 3n => O(n)
