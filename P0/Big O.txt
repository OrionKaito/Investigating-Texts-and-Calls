Task0:
This function is constant so it big o O(1)

Task1:
There are two loop but no nested so big o is 2n => O(n)

Task2:
There are two loop, one go through all of list of calls, next one to find the longest phone all
So 2n => O(n)

Task3:
Part A
There are three loop no nested 3n
Loop sort (nlogn)
=> big o is 3n + nlogn

Part B
Only one loop so big O is n

Big o is 3n + nlogn + n = nlogn + 4n

Task4
There are three loop no nest so big o is 3n 
Loop sort (nlogn)
=> big o is n + nlogn
